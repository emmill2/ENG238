				<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<p>For my Rhetorical application, I decided the best thing to do would be to try and convince my roommate of something that would benefit the both of us. The problem I was solving was how often she wanted me to take her grocery shopping.  Previously, we had been going to the grocery store on a weekly basis, which for me became an issue because I am the one driving and I simply did not need groceries that often.
					</p>
				<h2>Hypothesis</h2>
					<p>I believed that if I pointed out the wastefulness and inconvenience of driving to the store on a weekly basis rather than biweekly, she would be convinced to go on a less regular basis.
					</p>
				<h2>Procedure</h2>
					<p>To test this, I decided to wait until my roommate did not seem overly busy and just have an honest conversation with her.  I wanted to not have to guilt trip her as a friend, so I turned to more logical proofs that way my points had a more sound and less manipulative basis.  Seeing as I was the one who needed to drive, I decided I would mention gas money, as we never really split it seeing as it is a short drive.  This could also be seen as an appeal to my own authority, as the owner of my own car.</p>
					<p>If these logical proofs failed, I decided to appeal to pathos by pointing out that it is my car after all, and that although I am her friend, I do not want to be taken advantage of.  This would, however, be saved as more as a last attempt as I do not want to emotionally manipulate my roommate into listening to me.
					</p>
				<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>	Originally the experiment seemed as though it may be unsuccessful.  She pointed out that I do not drink milk, so she needed a quarter gallon and would run out within a week.  To refute this, I explained that they have quarter gallons at CVS, and she then agreed to walk to CVS to buy milk and then we would go together every other week to save money on gas and time in general.  I also explained that there is a bus system, so if I am unavailable she could just take the bus.
					</p>
					<p>Overall, I would say that it was very successful.  Neither of us ended up frustrated with each other, and now we have successfully settled a discussion that may have caused tension if left unattended.
					</p>
				<h2>Implications</h2>
					I learned that being forward with your audience, whoever it may be, is always the best approach to trying to convince them of something. Letting them be on the same level of understanding as you not only makes them feel validated by your mutual awareness, but causes the person to be less likely to go back on their agreement over time .
