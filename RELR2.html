          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          For my rhetorical application this time around, I wanted to do something that would have an immediate benefit to myself, although I followed up with a request that was completely unnecessary.  I decided to ask my boyfriend, Noah, if he would go to the store and buy me some epsom salt for my bath, seeing as I was extremely sick on top of being bruised from crashing my bike. Not only this, but I was literally too broke to buy it myself, something I would later use to convince him to get it for me.
          <h2>Hypothesis</h2>
          I believed that he would get the salt for me, but because he was trying to save money he would likely ask for me to pay him back, this is what I wanted to avoid.  I decided to be forthright about my lack of funds and let him know it would be entirely a favor, hopefully an act of goodwill on his part.

          <h2>Procedure</h2>
          We were sitting on the couch and he asked if there was anything he could do to help me feel better, I knew that this would be the perfect time.  I was hesitant in my asking; which, though unintentional on my part, worked to build a sense of ethos, with me being self aware that I was asking a lot of him considering the cold and the walk to the store.  I asked him to get the salt for me, and pointed out that he did ask if there was anything that would help.  It took little more than a moment for him to agree, and I knew that it was likely my appeal to pathos as being his girlfriend that convinced him. Also the fact that I was really sick.

          <h2>Results</h2>
          The end result was actually better than expected, he got me the more expensive lavender scented epsom salt for my bath, something I hadn’t even asked for.  I was very happy and grateful for his efforts. The unnecessary request came later when I asked him for lettuce, but it was mostly because I approached it jokingly and didn’t actually try and fight for my cause.

          <h2>Implications</h2>
          I think this all just shows the importance of knowing your audience.  If it is someone close to you, it will often be easier; but you have to balance that ease with not pushing or taking advantage of their kindness.
